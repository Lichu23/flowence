3. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Ensure good lighting and focus
5. Check console for QuaggaJS errors

### Email Not Received

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Resend API key is correct
2. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
3. Look in spam/junk folder
4. Verify sender email/domain is configured
5. Check server logs for email errors
6. Ensure `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is valid

### Search Not Finding Sales

**Problem:** Search returns "Sale not found"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify receipt number is correct
2. Check if sale belongs to current store
3. Ensure user has permission to view sale
4. Check server logs for errors

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in production:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=your_production_db
JWT_SECRET=your_production_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Optional but recommended
RESEND_API_KEY=re_production_key
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_FROM_NAME=Your Store Name
```

### HTTPS Requirement

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Barcode scanner requires HTTPS in production
- Camera API only works on secure origins
- Use SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)

### Resend Production

For production email sending:
1. Upgrade Resend plan if needed (>3,000 emails/month)
2. Add and verify your custom domain
3. Set up domain authentication (SPF/DKIM)
4. Configure webhook for delivery tracking
5. Monitor email reputation and deliverability
