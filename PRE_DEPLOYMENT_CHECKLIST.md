## Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend Locally
```bash
cd server
npm run build && npm start
curl http://localhost:3002/health
```

### Test Frontend Locally
```bash
cd flowence-client
npm run build && npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Test Full Stack Locally
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd flowence-client && npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000 and test all features
```

## Deployment Order

1. âœ… Complete this checklist
2. ðŸš€ Deploy Backend (Railway/Render)
3. ðŸš€ Deploy Frontend (Vercel)
4. ðŸ”„ Update Backend CORS with Frontend URL
5. âœ… Run post-deployment tests
6. ðŸ“Š Monitor for 24 hours
