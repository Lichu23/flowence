# Migration Guide: SendGrid to Resend

## Why Resend?

We've migrated from SendGrid to Resend for the following reasons:

1. **Better Developer Experience** - Simpler API, better documentation
2. **More Generous Free Tier** - 3,000 emails/month vs SendGrid's 100/day
3. **Modern Infrastructure** - Built for modern applications
4. **Easier Setup** - No complex domain verification for testing
5. **Better Deliverability** - Higher inbox placement rates
6. **React Email Support** - Future-ready for React-based templates

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install Resend Package

```bash
cd server
npm install resend@^4.0.1
npm uninstall @sendgrid/mail sendgrid
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

**Old (.env with SendGrid):**
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Your Store Name
```

**New (.env with Resend):**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
RESEND_FROM_NAME=Your Store Name
```

### 3. Get Resend API Key

1. **Sign up at Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/
   - Create a free account
   - No credit card required

2. **Generate API Key:**
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
   - Add to your `.env` file

3. **Configure Sender Email:**
   - **For Testing:** Use `onboarding@resend.dev` (no verification needed)
   - **For Production:** Add and verify your custom domain

### 4. Verify the Migration

The code changes have already been made. You just need to:

1. Update your `.env` file with Resend credentials
2. Restart your server
3. Test sending an invitation

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Email Sending

1. Go to your application
2. Navigate to Users/Team page
3. Click "Invite Employee"
4. Enter an email address
5. Check the Resend dashboard for delivery status
6. Verify the email was received

## Domain Verification (Production Only)

### For Testing
Use `onboarding@resend.dev` - no verification needed!

### For Production

1. **Add Your Domain:**
   - Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Domains
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

2. **Add DNS Records:**
   Resend will provide DNS records to add:
   - SPF record (TXT)
   - DKIM record (TXT)
   - DMARC record (TXT) - optional but recommended

3. **Verify Domain:**
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
   - Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard
   - Once verified, update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use your domain

4. **Update Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```
